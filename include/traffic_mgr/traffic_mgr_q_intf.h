/**
 * @brief Allocates Queues and Sets Queue Mapping per Port
 * This API can be used to allocate flexible number of queues behind a port.
 * By default straight mapping is established. If flexible queue mapping is
 * desired, this API can be used.
 * Default mapping or when q_mapping is NULL, queue mapping is according to
 * following calculation.
 *    queue# = Ig_intr_md.qid % q_count.
 *    Example Queue mapping in default mode:
 *                   Ig_intr_md.qid 0 --> port qid 0
 *                   Ig_intr_md.qid 1 --> port qid 1
 *                         :
 *                   Ig_intr_md.qid 7 --> port qid 7
 *                         :
 *
 * NOTE: If this API gets called for changing the queue carving (queue count),
 * then application should
 *   - always call queue mapping APIs strictly in increasing order of ports
 *      within a port group
 *   - if queue count gets changed for a port/channel in a port group,
 *      then application should call the queue mapping APIs
 *      for rest of the ports after it (if present) in that port group in
 *      increasing order
 *   - if queue count gets changed, then calling this API while traffic
 *      running on any port within the port group is not recommended as
 *      traffic would be disrupted for a short period of time and buffer
 *      accounting would be inconsistent
